## Sample games

This repository contains four very simple game ideas:

1. A trivia game with an [AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/) backend
1. A "repeat after me" game where you click the colors in the same order the game generates
1. A Tic Tac Toe game
1. [Tower of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
