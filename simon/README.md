# Simon
Simple Implementation of the Simon game!

## Motivation
I was helping students write simple JavaScript games and got inspired to try writing Simon using a queue data structure.

## Code Style
I use standard JS.

## Built With
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
  * Materialize CSS

## Features
The implementation is simple, but the underlying data structures make the code more efficient.
