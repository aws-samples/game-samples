# Towers of Hanoi

## Motivation
A bunch of my students write Towers of Hanoi for their project one, so I wanted to try it out!

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript.

## Features
This game is pretty simple - it uses just vanilla JS. The CSS was definitely the hard part for this one! I want to get better with FlexBox.

## Stack

Game is deployed at aspittel.github.io/towers-of-hanoi/

## Local Installation
